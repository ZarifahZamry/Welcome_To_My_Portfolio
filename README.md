# Data Analytics Portfolio

👋 Hi there! I'm Zarifah Zamry, your friendly data explorer on a mission to make numbers as fun as a game of basketball! 🏀 Formerly strutting the aisles at H&M, I then took a leap into the startup world with McKinsey by my side. 🚀 Proud alumni of the Young Leadership Academy, where I learned the dance of leadership. Now, I'm orchestrating the production game at Sony while shooting hoops on the side. 🎮 Exciting news—I've scored a scholarship from YSEALI and proudly earned my stripes in Data Engineering Professional certificate from IBM, with a sprinkle of Google Data Analytics Professional certificate magic through Coursera. 🌟 Let's spin data into slam dunks and turn insights into three-pointers! 🌈 #DataBallin #AnalyticsAdventurer #BasketballDreamer"
